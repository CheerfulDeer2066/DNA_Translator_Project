v1.1
 - Added a minimum size and title to the window
 - Changed translation code to change Ts in strands marked as RNA and Us in strands marked as DNA to null characters, causing the code to recognize it an invalid input
 - Changed variables named "anticodons" back to "codons" (as it should be)
 - Moved "Invalid Input" check to after codon length check so that an invalid input takes priority
