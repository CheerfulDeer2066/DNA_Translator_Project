v1.1
 - Added a minimum size and title to the window
 - Changed translation code to change Ts in strands marked as RNA and Us in strands marked as DNA to null characters, causing the code to recognize it an invalid input
 - Changed variables named "anticodons" back to "codons" (as it should be)
 - Moved "Invalid Input" check to after codon length check so that an invalid input takes priority

v1.1.1
 - Defined main function to make program easier to read
 - moved pack methods for outputs to a new line to prevent possible errors
 - fixed error in input entry assignment
 - removed window.maxsize assignment
 - NOTE: program ignores invalid characters when they're at the start of a codon
    - Current codon splitting code splits it in sets of 3, so anything that's shorter than 3 is entirely ignored
